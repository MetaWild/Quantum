# Quantum

## About this folder

This folder contains all of my quantum-related projects, experiments, and reference code. The top-level README intentionally stays minimal: it shows the immediate structure and a short description so you can quickly find subprojects.

For details about a specific project or code file, open the README inside that subfolder (for example, `Error-Correction/README.md`) — those READMEs contain per-project explanations, usage instructions, and any example scripts.

## Structure

- `Error-Correction/` — Quantum error correction projects, implementations, and notes (3-qubit bit-flip, Shor code, etc.).
